This project is an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by letting them race side by side on the same dataset.

Using matplotlib animations, each algorithm is shown as a series of vertical bars that move and swap as the algorithm progresses. The barsâ€™ heights represent the values being sorted. As the algorithms run in parallel, you can visually compare their behaviors, speeds, and patterns.
